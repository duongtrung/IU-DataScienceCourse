    "## Example 1: Peer-to-Peer Lending (Finance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Business Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Peer-to-peer lending (abbreviated P2P) occurs when investors lend money directly to individuals or businesses through an online service. The online server provider matches lenders with borrowers, and conducts the analysis required to determine the loan interest rate to be charged to the borrower and the risk incurred by the lender. There is usually a lower operating cost to peer-to-peer lending, therefore investors tend to get higher returns and borrowers lower loan rates, although this is now always the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Company: Lending Club\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lending Club** is a peer-to-peer Lending company based in the US. Lending Club matches people looking to invest money with people looking to borrow money. When investors invest their money through Lending Club, the money is passed onto borrowers, and when borrowers pay their loans back, the capital plus the interest passes on back to the investors. This product is called unsecured personal loans. To learn more about Lending Club visit their [website](https://www.lendingclub.com/).\n",

    "Perhaps one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 people on board. Interestingly, by analysing the probability of survival based on few attributes like gender, age, and social status, we can make very accurate predictions on which passengers would survive. Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. Therefore, we can learn about the society priorities and privileges at the time.\n",

    "## Example 1: Peer-to-Peer Lending (Finance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Business Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Peer-to-peer lending (abbreviated P2P) occurs when investors lend money directly to individuals or businesses through an online service. The online server provider matches lenders with borrowers, and conducts the analysis required to determine the loan interest rate to be charged to the borrower and the risk incurred by the lender. There is usually a lower operating cost to peer-to-peer lending, therefore investors tend to get higher returns and borrowers lower loan rates, although this is now always the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Company: Lending Club\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lending Club** is a peer-to-peer Lending company based in the US. Lending Club matches people looking to invest money with people looking to borrow money. When investors invest their money through Lending Club, the money is passed onto borrowers, and when borrowers pay their loans back, the capital plus the interest passes on back to the investors. This product is called unsecured personal loans. To learn more about Lending Club visit their [website](https://www.lendingclub.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lending Club dataset contains complete loan data for all loans issued through 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. Features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes and state, and collections among others. Collections indicates whether the customer has missed one or more payments and the team is trying to recover the money.\n",

    "The dataset contains about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables. More detail on this dataset can be found in [Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshsng/lending-club-loan-data-csv?resource=download)\n",

    "## Example 2: Predicting Survival on the Titanic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "Perhaps one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 people on board. Interestingly, by analysing the probability of survival based on few attributes like gender, age, and social status, we can make very accurate predictions on which passengers would survive. Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. Therefore, we can learn about the society priorities and privileges at the time.\n",
